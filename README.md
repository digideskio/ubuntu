# Ubuntu

Configurations and Wiki entries I plan to start collecting to finally share my Linux (Ubuntu) knowledge.  Since I've been too lazy over the years to make all that I know public.  This is a mixture of configurations for servers and laptops/desktops.  It does not make any discretion between the two so browse the files and pick what applies to you.
